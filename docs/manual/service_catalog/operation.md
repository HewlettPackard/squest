## Job template config

By default, Squest will execute the selected Job Template with the config as set in RHAAP/AWX. 

If a field is configured to "Prompt on launch" in RHAAP/AWX, the administrator can override it from the "Process" page of an accepted request:

Overridable fields:

- Inventory (ID)
- Limit (hosts)
- Tags
- Skip tags
- Verbosity
- Job type
- Diff mode (Show changes)
- Credentials (Comma separated list of ID)

The "default" configuration set at operation level allow to automatically pre-fill the "Process" page with values.

Jinja templating can be used in the default value based on the current `{{ request }}` object as context.
Examples can be retrieved in the [dedicated documentation section](../jinja.md). Full `request` object definition can be retrieved through the [API documentation](../api.md).

Default value precedence:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    RHAAP/AWX(Default from RHAAP/AWX) --> Squest(Default from Squest) --> Process(Process request page)
```

!!! note

    **Default inventory ID** field is expecting an integer that correspond the the inventory ID in RHAAP/AWX.

    **Default credential IDs** field is expecting a comma separated list of integer that correspond existings credentials ID in RHAAP/AWX.


## Approval

By default, _Requests_ can be approved by any administrator when
_Approval Workflow_ is not defined in the _Operation_. After being approved, the _Request_ is in 'ACCEPTED' state and can be
processed.

### Approval Workflow

An _Approval Workflow_ is composed by one or multiple [_Approval Step_](#approval-step).
_Approval Steps_ of the Workflow must be approved one by one following the order. After accepting the last one, the
request witch to 'ACCEPTED' state and can be processed.

!!! note

      The auto-accept option can not be set in the _Operation_ with an Approval Workflow.

### Approval Step

An _Approval Step_ can only be approved by its _Teams_ members. It is approved when all _Teams_ approved the _Request_ or at
least one depending on the [Type](#type).

!!! note

      Approval Steps are linked to Teams and not users. It means that any member can approved for his Team.

| Name  | Description                                                            |
|-------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Name  | Unique identifier of the _Approval Step_ in the _Approval Workflow_.   |
| Type  | Defined how the _Approval Step_ is Approved. See supported types below |
| Teams | List of Teams that can approve the Approval Step.                      |


**Type**

- **At least one:** At least one team must approve the _Approval Step_ to move to the next one.
- **All of them:** All teams of the _Approval Step_ must approve to move to the next one.


## Survey

The survey of an operation can be edited to change the behavior of the generated form of a request.

!!! note

    Surveys in Squest are actually surveys attached to each job templates in your RHAAP/AWX.
    Squest can only disable the ones that you don't want to be filled by your end users.
    Those fields, if declared as mandatory on RHAAP/AWX, will need to be filled anyway by the admin when approving a request.

### End user field

An **end user field**  is a field that will be displayed into the end user survey.
By default, all fields are enabled when creating a new operation.

!!! note

    If the field is set as **required** into the RHAAP/AWX job template survey config then the administrator
    will have to fill it in any case during the review of the request.

### Default value


When set, the default value is pre-filled into the final form. It takes precedence over the default value set in RHAAP/AWX job template survey config.

Default value precedence:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    RHAAP/AWX(Default from RHAAP/AWX) --> squest(Default from Squest value) --> User(User's input)  --> Admin(Admin's input)
```

!!! note

    When used with a 'multiple select' or 'multiple select multiple' type of field, the value need to be a valid one from the RHAAP/AWX survey field options.

**Jinja templating**

Jinja templating can be used in the default value based on the current `{{ instance }}` object as context.
Examples can be retrieved in the [dedicated documentation section](../jinja.md).

Full `instance` object definition can be retrieved through the [API documentation](../api.md).
