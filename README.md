Squest is a framework that allow you to expose an **Everything-as-a-Service** web portal. 

Exposed services in Squest are not hard coded. A service is actually a pointer to your automation in the backend engine Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform(RHAAP)/AWX (formerly known as Ansible Tower). 
It means everything, as long as it exists as an automation script, can be exposed as a service. **The only limit is your own capability of automation**.

More than a fire and forget tool, Squest can store in its database each deployed instance of services it has provisioned so you can attach to them more automation that allow 
your users to **manage the lifecycle** of their resources. 
Each operation corresponds to another link to an automation process in the backend. This allows to make end users more autonomous and free you from time spent in support 
and object update management.
