Squest is a sophisticated framework that empowers you to create a web portal offering a comprehensive **Everything-as-a-Service** experience.

In Squest, the services made available are not hardcoded. Instead, each service serves as a reference to your automation capabilities within the backend engine, 
Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform (RHAAP)/AWX (formerly known as Ansible Tower). This essentially means that anything, as long as it exists as an automation script, 
can be transformed into a service. Your only limitation lies in your own proficiency in automation.

Going beyond mere deployment, Squest maintains a record of every instance of services it provisions in its database. 
This allows you to augment these instances with additional automation, enabling your users to effectively manage the lifecycle of their resources. 
Each operation performed corresponds to yet another link to an automation process in the backend. This empowering feature enhances user autonomy, 
relieving you of the burden of providing extensive support and managing object updates.
